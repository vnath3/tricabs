            <p>
                Varanasi, also known as Kashi or Banaras, is one of the oldest living cities in the world and a major
                pilgrimage destination for Hindus. Situated on the banks of the sacred river Ganges, Varanasi is known
                for
                its spiritual significance, vibrant culture, and rich history.<br><br>
                Varanasi is home to numerous temples, ghats (riverfront steps leading to the river), and ashrams, making
                it
                a hub of religious and cultural activities. The city is known for its Ganga Aarti, a mesmerizing ritual
                that takes place every evening on the ghats, where priests perform prayers with fire as an offering to
                the
                river Ganges.<br><br>
                Apart from its spiritual significance, Varanasi is also famous for its rich cultural heritage. The city

                cuisine,
                Varanasi offers a glimpse into the heart and soul of India.<br><br>
                When it comes to transportation, Varanasi offers a variety of options including cycle rickshaws,
