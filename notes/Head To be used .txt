---------Sccript issues reason ------------
The issue in your previous code was likely due to the timing of when the mobileNumber variable was being set and used. Here's a breakdown of the issues and the changes made to resolve them:

Timing of config.js loading: In your original code, you were assuming that config.js sets a global variable mobileNumber. If config.js was not loaded or executed before your script, the mobileNumber variable would be undefined when your script tried to use it.

Use of innerHTML with an <a> element: In your original code, you were using innerHTML to append an <a> element to mobileNumberContainer. This can be problematic because modifying the innerHTML of an <a> element can interfere with its existing properties, such as the href attribute.

The revised code addresses these issues as follows:

Check for mobileNumber existence: The revised code checks if mobileNumber is defined before calling updateMobileNumber. This ensures that the function is only called when mobileNumber is available.

Use of <span> instead of <a> for mobileNumberContainer: To avoid potential issues with modifying the innerHTML of an <a> element, the revised code uses a <span> element for mobileNumberContainer. This allows you to safely set the textContent of the <span> element without affecting its attributes.

By making these changes, the code ensures that updateMobileNumber is only called when mobileNumber is defined and uses a <span> element for mobileNumberContainer to avoid potential issues with modifying the innerHTML of an <a> element.
